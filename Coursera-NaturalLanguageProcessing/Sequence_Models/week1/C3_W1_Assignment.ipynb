    "# Assignment 1:  Sentiment with Deep Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of course 3. In this assignment, you will explore sentiment analysis using deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note on Submission to the AutoGrader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp/supplement/6ThZO/how-to-refresh-your-workspace)."

    "- You will now build a data generator that takes in the positive/negative tweets and returns a batch of training examples. It returns the model inputs, the targets (positive or negative labels) and the weight for each target (ex: this allows us to can treat some examples as more important to get right than others, but commonly this will all be 1.0). \n",
