    "# Basic Attention Operation: Ungraded Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've learned, attention allows a seq2seq decoder to use information from each encoder step instead of just the final encoder hidden state. In the attention operation, the encoder outputs are weighted based on the decoder hidden state, then combined into one context vector. This vector is then used as input to the decoder to predict the next output step.\n",

    "\n",
    "![alignment model](./images/alignment_model_3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $h_j$ are the encoder hidden states for each input step $j$ and $s_{i - 1}$ is the decoder hidden state of the previous step. The first layer corresponds to $W_a$ and $U_a$, while the second layer corresponds to $v_a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, first concatenate the encoder and decoder hidden states to produce an array with size $K \\times 2n$ where $K$ is the number of encoder states/steps. For this, use `np.concatenate` ([docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.concatenate.html)). Note that there is only one decoder state so you'll need to reshape it to successfully concatenate the arrays. The easiest way is to use `decoder_state.repeat` ([docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.repeat.html#numpy.repeat)) to match the hidden state array size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, apply the first layer as a matrix multiplication between the weights and the concatenated input. Use the tanh function to get the activations. Finally, compute the matrix multiplication of the second layer weights and the activations. This returns the alignment scores."
