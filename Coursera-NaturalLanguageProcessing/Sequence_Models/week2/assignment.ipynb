    "Your task will be to predict the next set of characters using the previous characters. \n",
    "- Although this task sounds simple, it is pretty useful.\n",
    "- You will start by converting a line of text into a tensor\n",
    "- Then you will create a generator to feed data into the model\n",
    "- You will train a neural network in order to predict the new set of characters of defined length. \n",
    "- You will use embeddings for each character and feed them as inputs to your model. \n",
    "    - Many natural language tasks rely on using embeddings for predictions. \n",
    "- Your model will convert each character to its embedding, run the embeddings through a Gated Recurrent Unit `GRU`, and run it through a linear layer to predict the next set of characters.\n",

    "- You will get the embeddings;\n",
    "- Stack the embeddings on top of each other;\n",

    "- Use the softmax output and identify the word with the highest probability.\n",
    "- The word with the highest probability is the prediction for the next word."
